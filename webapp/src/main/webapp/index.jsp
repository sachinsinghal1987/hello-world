<h3> Jenkins is a powerful, open source automation tool with an impressive plugin architecture that helps development teams automate their software lifecycle. Jenkins is used to power many industry-leading companies' software development pipelines. Jenkins Pipeline is a powerful, first-class feature for managing complex, multi-step pipelines. Jenkins Pipeline, a set of open source plugins and integrations, brings the power of Jenkins and the plugin ecosystem into a scriptable Domain Specific Language (DSL). Best of all, like Jenkins core, Pipeline is extensible by third-party developers, supporting custom extensions to the Pipeline DSL and various options for plugin integration.

	The Pipeline plugin was formerly known as the Workflow plugin prior to version 1.13 of the plugin. CHODDDAAAAA MUHHHH om namah shivay </h3>
